OVERVIEW:
When I was studying poetry in college, I wished for a tool that could help with traditional poetry formatting. A sestina, for example, requires a repetition of the final word in a poem's stanzas that follow a consistent cycle. It's hard to explain, but it's very easy to look at. This tool allows you to take an easy look at tricky poetry traditions. It's designed for curious writers who want to play around with rhyme and learn a bit about literature without the tuition price or the stuffy lecture.

FEATURES:
1. Sestina Formatter: Users will be able to create poems using tool that re-arranges user input according to the format.
2. Rhyme API: Users will be able to search for rhyming words.
3. Style Option: Users can change the font style of their resulting poem

TECHNOLOGIES:
Java
Spring Boot 
Hibernate 
Thymeleaf templates
Rhyme API
