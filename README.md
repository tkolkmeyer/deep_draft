# deep_draft

OVERVIEW:
When I was studying poetry in college, I wished for a tool that could help with traditional poetry formatting. A sestina, for example, requires a repetition of the final word in each line of a poem's stanzas to follow a consistent cycle. These poetry traditions can be tricky to explain. That's why Deep Draft is designed to map these formats outâ€” so students can hone their craft and the curiousity of writers can flourish!

FEATURES:
1. Sestina Formatter: Users will be able to create poems using tool that re-arranges user input according to the format.
2. Info pages: Internal pages providing examples, explanations, tips and tricks for poetry crafting.
3. Style Option: Users can change the font style of their resulting poem.
