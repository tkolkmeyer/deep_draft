    <h1>What's an envoi?</h1>
    <h3>An envoi is a final message in any poem. It's not a term that is specific to the sestina.

        </br>
        You can think of it as the post script of a letter, an opportunity to speak directly to the reader, or to the subject of the poem.
        It's optional! Your sestina will still qualify as a sestina without the envoi.
        </br>
        </br>
        If you do choose to create an envoi in your sestina, you'll be creating three final lines with the first and sixth end words in line one, the fourth and third end words in line two, and the fifth and second end words in line three.
        </br>
        </br>
        The reasoning for this is so each line adds to seven.
        </br>
        The reason it adds to seven? . . . Because seven is lucky??
        </br>
        Who knows! Have fun with it!</h3>

    <h3>My absolute favorite envoi in a poem is in Elizabeth Bishop's "One Art." The formatting style of "One Art" is called a villanelle.</h3>

    <h3>The way this poem shifts from speaking to the reader to speaking to the subject ("â€”Even losing you"), could be described as the <b>volta</b> of the poem. The <b>volta</b> of a poem describes the point in a poem that turns it's voice or perspective. The technique is originally associated with Shakesperean sonnets that transition into a speaker who supplies a conclusion to the poem.</h3>
