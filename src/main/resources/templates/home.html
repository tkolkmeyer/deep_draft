<h1>Deep Draft Poetry Formatter</h1>
<body>
<p>When I was studying poetry in college, I wished for a tool that could help with traditional poetry formatting.</p>
<p>A sestina, for example, requires a repetition of the final word in a poem's stanzas that follow a consistent cycle.</p>
<p> It's hard to explain, but it's very easy to look at.</p>
<p>This tool allows you to take an easy look at tricky poetry traditions.</p>
<p>It's designed for curious writers who want to play around with rhyme and learn a bit about literature without the tuition price or the stuffy lecture.</p>
